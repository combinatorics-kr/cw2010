## Abstracts


### Sang-il Oum (KAIST)
**Title:** Hyperbolic surface subgroups of one-ended doubles of free groups  
**Abstract:** Gromov asked whether every one-ended word-hyperbolic group contains a hyperbolic surface group. We prove that every one-ended double of a free group has a hyperbolic surface subgroup if (1) the free group has rank two, or (2) every generator is used the same number of times in the amalgamating words. To prove this, we formulate a stronger statement on Whitehead graphs and prove its specialization by combinatorial induction for (1) and the characterization of perfect matching polytopes by Edmonds for (2). 

This is joint work with Sang-hyun Kim.

### Hyun Kwang Kim (POSTECH)
**Title:** Polytope numbers  
**Abstract:** We present recent developments in the theory of polytope numbers.

### Mark Siggers (Kyungbook National University)
**Title:** Intersecting and Union Families of Sets  
**Abstract:** We present some Erdos-Ko-Rado type results about the maximum size of set families satisfying intersection conditions (of the family and their complement). We consider a weighted version of the problem, and the case in which every set in the family has the same size.

In particular we find the maximum size of a k-uniform family of subsets of [n] such that every r sets intersect, and every s sets in the complement intersect. We complement this with stability results, show that the maximum can only be achieved by families where at least one of the intersection conditions is obtained ‘trivially’.

This is joint work with Norihide Toushige.

### Dan Drake (KAIST)
**Title:** A bijection from weighted Dyck paths to Schroeder paths, little and big  
**Abstract:** In previous work, Jang Soo KIM and I showed that the number of Dyck paths in which downsteps at even height have weight 2 is the same as the number of little Schroeder paths. I will show a bijective proof of this that also shows that Dyck paths in which downsteps at odd height are equinumerous with big Schroeder paths.

### Hana Kim (Sungkyunkwan University)
**Title:** Combinatorial interpretations for k-consistent Riordan arrays  
**Abstract:** A Riordan array is said to be consistent if its A-sequence and Z-sequence are identical. As continuation of the previous work, we give combinatorial interpretations for the consistent Riordan arrays in terms of Schröder paths, Motzkin paths, ordered trees, and integer partitions. Further, we extend the consistent Riordan array to a k-consistent Riordan array.

### Boram Park (Seoul National University)
**Title:** The competition numbers of circulant graphs  
**Abstract:** The competition graph of a digraph D is a graph which has the same vertex set as D and has an edge between two distinct vertices x and y if and only if there exists a vertex v in D such that (x, v) and (y, v) are arcs of D. For any graph G, G together with sufficiently many isolated vertices is the competition graph of some acyclic digraph. The competition number k(G) of a graph G is defined to be the smallest number of such isolated vertices. Characterizing a graph by its competition number has been one of important research problems in the study of competition graphs. Opsut conjectured that the competition number of a locally cobipartite graph is at most 2. It has been open for more than 25 years even if partial results had been obtained.

In this paper, we focus on the competition number of a circulant graph which is locally cobipartite. We show that certain circulant graphs including the complement of cycles still satisfy Opsut’s conjecture.

### Wonjin Park (Seoul National University)
**Title:** List dynamic coloring of planar graph  
**Abstract:** Dynamic coloring of a graph G is a proper coloring of G in which each vertex neighborhood of size at least 2 receives at least two distinct colors. The list dynamic chromatic number of G is the least k such that for any assignment of k-element lists to the vertices of G, there is a dynamic coloring of G where the color on each vertex is chosen from its list. We study list dynamic chromatic number of planar graphs. This is joint work with Seog-Jin Kim.

### Joonkyung Lee (Korea Military Academy)
**Title:** Rank-width of Random Graphs  
**Abstract:** Rank-width of a graph G, denoted by rw(G) is a graph width parameter introduced by Oum and Seymour(2006).

We investigate the asymptotic behavior of rank-width of a random graph G(n, p), which is a graph on n vertices such that two vertices are adjacent with the probability p independently at random. This model of random graphs was introduced by Erdős and Rényi (1960).

Using technical inequalities concerning the rank of random matrices, we show that asymptotically almost surely

(i) if p ∈ (0, 1) is a constant then rw(G(n, p)) = ⌈n/3⌉ − O(1),  
(ii) if 1/n ≪ p ≤ 1/2, then rw(G(n, p)) = ⌈n/3⌉ − o(n),  
(iii) if p = c/n and c > 1 then rw(G(n, p)) ≥ rn for some r = r(c), and  
(iv) if p = c/n and c < 1 then rw(G(n, p)) ≤ 2.

Thus, it is shown that G(n, p) has the sharp threshold p(n) = 1/n with respect to having linear rank-width. This is joint work with Choongbum Lee and Sang-il Oum.


### Soojin Cho (Ajou University)
**Title:** Schur P-functions  
**Abstract:** Schur Q (and P)-functions were introduced by Schur in 1911 in relation to the projective representation of the symmetric group. We introduce well-known combinatorial results on Schur P-functions and give a new description of the structural constant (shifted Littlewood-Richardson coefficient) in terms of words.


### Mitsugu Hirasaka (Pusan National University)
**Title:** Equitable partitions in a balanced coherent configuration  
**Abstract:** Let (Ω,R) be a coherent configuration. We say that (Ω,R) is balanced if the number of elements of R in the cartesian product of any two fibers is constant. In this talk we consider equitable partitions of a homogeneous component of (Ω,R) and characterize them if (Ω,R) is balanced and the size of a fiber is a prime.

### Lee-Chae Jang (Konkuk University)
**Title:** Some properties of q-Bernstein polynomials  
**Abstract:** In the present paper, we propose the modified q-Bernstein polynomials of degree n, which are different q-Bernstein polynomials of Phillips. From these the modified q-Bernstein polynomials of degree n, we derive some interesting recurrence formulae for the modified q-Bernstein polynomials.

### Sangwook Kim (KAIST)
**Title:** Topology of diagonal arrangements  
**Abstract:** We show that if a simplicial complex is shellable, then the singularity link of the corresponding diagonal arrangement is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. Also, we give some examples of diagonal arrangements whose complements are K(π, 1), coming from rank 3 matroids.

### Kyoung-Suk Park (Ajou University)
**Title:** Combinatorics of permutation tableaux  
**Abstract:** We study some combinatorial properties of permutation tableaux; review known results and improve some of them. Permutation tableaux are in bijection with permutations, and their structure is more transparent than the structure of permutations. Thus, permutation tableaux are useful in the understanding of permutations. There is a well-known bijection between permutation tableaux and permutations; and we define a simple algorithm to find the corresponding permutation tableau of a given permutation under this bijection. There are several known bijections on the set of permutation tableaux showing that certain statistics have the same distribution. We consider a new bijection showing that alignments and crossings of certain types have the same distribution on permutation tableaux.
